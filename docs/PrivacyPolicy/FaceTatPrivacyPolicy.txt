Privacy Policy

Patrick Doyle built the Face Tattoo app as a free app in its current state. This SERVICE is provided by Patrick Doyle at no cost and is intended for use as is.  The app may use in app purchases in the future but does not at the moment. 

This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use

The Face Tattoo AR app uses the TrueDepth API to get a map of the user's face geometry so that it can take an image of a tattoo and project it on to the user's face, giving the user the illusion that the tattoo is actually on their face.  Specifically, the map will take an image of a tattoo with a transparent background and apply/project the image directly to the user's facial geometry.  This TrueDepth API and facial geometry image projection is needed for the app to function since the purpose of the app is to allow users to visualize tattoos/images/drawings on their face.  

None of the data/information collected by the TrueDepth API is saved or stored except (except for when the app is running, the data will need to be stored in the user's local memory).  This data is not saved or shared with any 3rd parties.  

It is possible for the user of the app to save an image of the tattoo projected onto their face to their phone's image gallery if they wish.  

Currently, Face Tattoo app does not collect or store any other user data.  The app may request you to access images from your gallery or save images to your gallery if you wish, but the app does not store or save any of these photos anywhere besides on your local device.
